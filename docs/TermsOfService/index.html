Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Ninjachain Labs are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">YOU AND NINJACHAIN LABS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Ninjachain Labs should be sent to 252 Nassau Street, Floor 2, Princeton, New Jersey 08542 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Ninjachain Labs and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Ninjachain Labs may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Ninjachain Labs or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Ninjachain Labs is entitled.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Arbitration Procedures</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Unless Ninjachain Labs and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Ninjachain Labs agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Costs of Arbitration</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Ninjachain Labs will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Ninjachain Labs will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Ninjachain Labs will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Confidentiality</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">Severability</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.

Ninjachain Labs reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.
General</p><p>These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Ninjachain Labs governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Ninjachain Labs with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Ninjachain Labs submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York, New York. The failure of Ninjachain Labs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Ninjachain Labs, but Ninjachain Labs may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.</p><p>The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service. Ninjachain Labs will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes beyond Ninjachain Labs’ reasonable control.
U.S. Government Restricted Rights</p><p>The Service is made available to the U.S. government with “RESTRICTED RIGHTS.” Use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. government is subject to the restrictions contained in 48 CFR 52.227-19 and 48 CFR 252.227-7013 et seq. or its successor.
